# Create a program that asks for a number and prints the multiplication table with that number
#
# Example:
# The number 15 should print:
#
# 1 * 15 = 15
# 2 * 15 = 30
# 3 * 15 = 45
# 4 * 15 = 60
# 5 * 15 = 75
# 6 * 15 = 90
# 7 * 15 = 105
# 8 * 15 = 120
# 9 * 15 = 135
# 10 * 15 = 150

number = int(input("Please specify the number of the table that you wish to view: "))
for i in range(11):# to stop at 10 we say 11
    print(number, "x",i, "=", number*i)
