# Add William to the list
# Print out whether the list is empty or not
# Add John to the list
# Add Amanda to the list
# Print out the number of elements in the list
# Print out the 3rd element
# Iterate through the list and print out each name
# William
# John
# Amanda
# Iterate through the list and print
# 1. William
# 2. John
# 3. Amanda
# Remove the 2nd element
# Iterate through the list in a reversed order and print out each name
# Amanda
# William
# Remove all elements
